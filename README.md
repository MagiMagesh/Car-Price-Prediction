# End-End-Model-Building

### 1. This model has Car Dataset.

### 2. Done the EDA and Feature Engineering 

### 3. In Feature Engineering Since the Features are less gone with the creation of dummy variables.

### 4. For Feature selection used ExtraTreesRegressor

### 5. Model / Classifior used for prediction RandomForestRegressor

### 6. RandomisedSearchCV used to test an Hyperparameters for RandomForestRegressor

In Next part will deal with different 
1. Feature Selection
2. Feature Selection Module like ChiSquare Test, MAD, Variance Threshold
3. Model / Classifior used for prediction like XG boost, Decision Tree, Linear Regression
