# End-End-Model-Building

### 1. This model has Car Dataset.

### 2. Done the EDA and Feature Engineering 

### 3. In Feature Engineering Since the Features are less gone with One Hot Encoding.

### 4. For Feature selection used ExtraTreesRegressor

### 5. Model / Classifior used for prediction RandomForestRegressor

### 6. RandomisedSearchCV used to test an Hyperparameters for RandomForestRegressor

In Next part will deal with different mehods like
1. Feature Engineering by using Categorical Encoding, Log Transform, Feature Grouping
2. Feature Selection Module like ChiSquare Test, MAD, Variance Threshold
3. Model / Classifior used for prediction like XG boost, Decision Tree, Linear Regression.
4. Grid Search used to test an Hyperparameters
